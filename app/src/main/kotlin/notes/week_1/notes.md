Classes :

1. Final 
- Koltin classes are by default final, which means they cant be overridden.
2. Open
- They are allowed to me made independently and also can be overridden.
3. Abstract
- They can only be implemented and cant be independently created.

Companion Object :

-An object shared across all the objects of a particular class.
-Should be used to share common data across all the objects of a class, for example a counter of all objects.

init{} block :
- this is the first block of code which runs when an object is created
- this should be used to do operations just after an object creation, for example updating some counter in the companion object.
